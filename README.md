# üî¥ Redstone Studio

**The first visual programming IDE designed specifically for Minecraft addon development**

---

## üöß Early Development

Redstone Studio is currently in active development. Features and APIs may change. **Star ‚≠ê this repo to follow progress!**

---

## What is Redstone Studio?

Redstone Studio revolutionizes Minecraft addon development by providing the first visual programming system that speaks Minecraft's native languages - MoLang, Component Groups, Entity Events, and Animation Controllers.

---

## The Problem

- Current tools force generic programming concepts onto Minecraft's unique systems
- Beginners struggle with complex JSON structures and programming concepts  
- Existing visual tools generate poor quality, hard-to-maintain code
- Workflow is fragmented across multiple applications (Blockbench, MCreator, code editors)

## The Solution

Redstone Studio provides Blueprint visual programming designed specifically for Minecraft:

- **Native Minecraft Nodes** - Work directly with MoLang expressions, Component Groups, and Entity Events
- **Perfect Code Generation** - Outputs clean, professional Minecraft addon files
- **Integrated Workflow** - Model editor, animator, and Blueprint system in one application
- **Beginner to Expert** - Visual for newcomers, powerful for professionals

## Getting Started

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Kotlin Multiplatform with Compose Multiplatform
- **3D Rendering:** Korender for cross-platform OpenGL rendering
- **Platform:** Desktop-first (Windows, macOS, Linux)
